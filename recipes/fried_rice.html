    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Simple Chinese dish consisting of day-old rice stir-fried in a wok, combined with scrambled eggs and veggies. 
        Takes 10 minutes to make and serves 3.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tablespoons (45 ml) vegetable or other neutral oil</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, thoroughly beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups (about 1 pound/450 g) cooked day-old rice</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons (10 ml) light soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 scallions, thinly sliced crosswise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a wok over high heat until lightly smoking. Add 1 tablespoon oil and swirl to coat. If cooking 
            on a powerful outdoor wok burner, reduce heat to minimum. If using a standard Western burner, keep heat 
            on high throughout cooking. Add eggs to center of wok and cook, swirling wok until eggs are puffy and 
            lightly browned on the bottom, about 10 seconds on a powerful burner or 30 seconds on a standard burner. 
            Flip eggs and lightly brown on second side. Push eggs up to the side of the wok.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the wok and swirl to coat. Add rice to center of wok. Flip eggs on top 
            of rice, then using a wok spatula, break the rice and eggs up, tossing and stirring as you break them. 
            Stir-fry until rice starts to pop and jump on its own when you set the wok down, about 1 minute on a 
            powerful burner or 2 to 3 minutes on a standard burner.</li>
        <li>Add remaining tablespoon of oil around the rim of the wok, then add the soy sauce to the same spot. 
            Stir-fry until rice and eggs are evenly coated in the soy sauce (the rice should be more or less broken 
            up into distinct grains without any large clumps). Add scallions. Remove from heat and toss to combine. 
            Transfer to a serving platter and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
